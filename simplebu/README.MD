# simplebu

`simplebu` is a straightforward utility designed for performing basic local backups. It enables users to easily backup and synchronize directories, ensuring that important files are duplicated and up-to-date in the backup location.

`simplebu.trilian` is setup specifically to backup the awesome notebook app 'Trilium' <https://github.com/zadam/trilium> which automatically creates a local DB backup, but it would be smart to copy that to a seperate drive.

## Features

- **Simple Backup:** Perform basic directory backups with minimal configuration.
- **Easy Scheduled Job Integration:** Because time based directories are utilized as well as the process name for folder name, it's easier to adopt this to recurring backup jobs.
- **Ease of Use:** User-friendly command-line interface for straightforward operations.
